### Introduction:

Our world has recently been living in a considerably fast-paced manner. 2020 alone has known a global pandemic, its consequent stock market crash, bushfires that have burnt a total of 47 million acres in Australia, the impeachment of former US president Donal Trump, as well as many other events that do not lack in details and intricacies around them. Oxymoronically enough, the generations that have just entered, or are about to enter, the workforce have laid aside the traditional sources of information (TV news and newspapers). Indeed, as "Social media 'outstrips TV' as news source for young people" [1], younger people can be seen prefering to document themselves about the world's major issues through social media (Twitter and Instagram mainly), readily available on their smartphones and laptops. This migration comes alongside with a different view on the value of news. According to [2],:

- Traditional news brands see news as: what you should know.
- Young audiences see news as: what you should know (to an extent), but also what is useful to know, what is interesting to know, and what is fun to know.

This shows that there has been an increase in the variety of information that younger news-consumers obtain. Nevertheless, the devil is in the detail, and such a broad scope of headlines can come at a cost: the news that "they should know" might get easily disregarded when drowned in a world of information about "what is interesting to know and what is fun to know". Misleading information, more easily spready through social media than through TV and newspapers, can make young people believe in false ideals and have inaccurate opinions. The problem that is faced here is one of misinformation regarding topics that require a critical mind and an embrace of the many fine details and intricacies around them.

*CauseVisualiser* therefore seeks to bring the critical mindset vehicled by the reading of many different newspapers back to life, and to bridge the gap between "thing that should be know" and "things that are fun to know", in order to hopefully get younger generations to possess a sufficiently deep knowldedge about serious topics and causes they are interested in so they can make use of a critical mind and reach a balanced, unbiased opinion on the matter. *CauseVisualiser* enables the user to search for a variety of articles about a topic of their choice, then to read them and finally to rate them in terms of how positive the information contained in the article just read is for the cause he believes in/is interested in. Their own, personal and biased point of view is then represented by a chess board where the disposition of the pieces depends on how positive the overall situation around th topic of choice is to the user's eyes. This useful and playful way of viewing a current situation of interest seeks make the activity of documenting oneself about serious topics more fun, and thus to make an intrinsically biased and personal point of view more critical and unbiased.

### Literature review:

#### Migration of news sources

As younger generations have been progressively incorportating the active world, the way people consume news has progressively shifted from TV news and non-digital newspapers to digital news on their laptops and smartphones. The importance of the former has been declining as "In the UK, the average number of minutes of television viewing for the population as a whole declined from a high of 241 minutes per day in 2012 to 216 minutes per day in 2015, a 10% decline in three years” [3]. Additionally, " newspaper circulation has been declining for the whole decade[(the 2000's)]" (Wake Tech, 2016). The loss of consumers of both of these two sources of news has been reflected in an incredible increase in the number of people to obtain their societal information from social media. The Reuters Institute of Journalism at Oxford University issued a study in 2016 showing that a vast portion of the main social media platforms, when it came to people under 25 years old, used these mainly for the consumption of news: ""Instagram news consumers were 11% of the social media population", "Twitter was statistically tied at 12%" and "Facebook leads with 36% of social media consumers using the social media giant for consuming news." (Reuters, 2016).

#### Different motivations and hence different results

As stated in the report issued by the Reuters Institute, the motivation for the consumption of news for the younger audiences has drastically changed. Whereas older generations used to and still to this day consume news in order to get informed about serious, important topics, people belonging to the "Generation Z" mainly seek news with two main goals:

- progress: "I want to develop myself peronsally", ""I have goals I want to reach in my personal life and my work life", "I want to escape the limits of societal
  expectations or stereotypes" and "I want to look after myself too",
  
- enjoyment: "I want to have fun experiences", "I want to be entertained" and "I want to do what I love".
  

This shift in motivations for the consumption of news could be both the result of and the cause of the prevalence of social media as a source of information: social media provides a more enjoyable platform, therefore the content is to be personalised to one's idea of self-imporvement and enjoyment / younger generations, by living in a world of abundance of information and goods, seek thus self-improvement and enjoyment rather than just becoming literate about the worlds' issues, therefore social media content is deemed more attactive. In any case, the motivations for reading news amongst young people stem from a search of "what it can do for them as individuals - rather than for society as whole" like older ppeople used to. (Reuters, date ??).

#### Consequences

These changes in the reasons for people to read the news have entailed, logically, a change in the content portrayed as news and thus have been "redefining
what constitutes news" (Reuters, date ??). As Derek Thomson states in *The Facebook effect in the news* (The Atlantic, 2014), only part of each Facebook user's feed deals with actual "news" (politics, important societal events, etc). The stats mentioned earlier (Reuters, 2016) about the amount of users on differnet social platforms that only wanted to consumer news from them also indicate another underlying phenomenon: those news are surrounded, or rather "drowned", in a sea of content that ranges from humour to self-help, passing by gossip. In *The Facebook effect in the news* (The Atlantic, 2014), the list of the most viral stories from Buzzfeed is displayed, and shows a wide variety of topics: terrorist attacks, music shows and why Ryan Gosling won't eat his cereal. In addition to this wide variety of topics, social media platforms make use algorithms to perosnalise the offer of content to the user, thus "creat[ing] a “filter bubble”—a unique universe of information for each person—that potentially leads to consuming a narrow selection of news sources and perspectives" (Pariser, 2011). Additionally, the spread of misleading, false, or inaccurate news is way more easiliy vehicled by social media platforms than by TV boradcasting stations and newspapers. (Zimmer, Franziska, et al., 2019).

This three-factor system has caused yoounger generations to be disengaged with actual "news" are by making them focus on content that produces "high-arousal emotions" (Berger, Milkman, 2012). (MAYBE HAD CONSEQUENCE OF LACK OF SERIOUS NEWS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE ??).

#### Usage of user representation through gamification for the development of new habits

According to *A brief history on gamification* (2015), the usage of gaming tools for purposes other than pure entertainment dates from 2002, when the *Serious Games* programs where created by Ben Sawyer and David Rejecsk to motivate and shape behaviours in american soldiers under simulated war environments. Since then, many other games were programmed with the purpose of teaching and shaping positive beahviours outside of the belligerant context, like *Games for Change* (created by Barry Joseph, Benjamin Stokes and Suzanne Seggerman to bring awareness and knowledge to the public about world-problems) and *Games for Health* (created by Ben Sawyer too witrh the objective of improving health and the delivery of healthcare).

However, according to Palmer, Lunceford and Patton [19] main key-elements of gamification are:

- Progress paths: as part of a perception of play, objectives/tasks are usually
  concise in games.
  
- Feedback and reward: adding feedback and rapid rewards (e.g., points,
  badges, statuses), at the right time, are used as indicators of success and are
  an important feature for motivation.
  
- Social connection: accompanied by Internet, social networks and mobile
  applications of all sorts, gamified solutions boost group dynamics.
  

This trend in an increasing motivation for the development of self-improvement programs through gamifcation has been paired up with an increasing demand in the quality of aethestics and technology from the users.

The use of gamification for self-improvement has been widely present in health related contexts (weight control, eating habits, exercise, smoking, hand hygiene, etc.). According to Daniel Johnson et. al. (*Gamification for health and wellbeing: A systematic review of the literature*, 2016) whoc carried out a study on 19 papers that report empirical evidence on the effect of gamification on health and wellbeing, just over half (59%) of the studies reported positive effects, whereas 41% reported mixed or neutral effects. This indicates the presence of only a slight adavantage of using gamification for the promotion of health-related habits over the absence of gamification.

Other self-improvement sectors have know gamification, such as the promotion of civic and positive societal behaviours. For example, a study described in *Use of Gamification Techniques to Encourage Garbage Recycling. A Smart City Approach* (Alfonso Gonzalez Briones et. al.) was made around the effect of the installation of "smart" garbage containers in Zaragoza, Spain, that could record the "recycling" score of each perosn to use them, thus falling in the "progress paths" type of useful gamification mentioned above. The results show that "citizen participation increased by 32.2% and the amount of waste recycled increased by 17.2% in comparison to the data obtained before the implementation of [their] system."

Additionally, the education sector has been heavily coupled with gamification techniques in the past years. Jenni Majuri et. al. point out in *Gamification of education and learning: A review of empirical* (2018) that out of 128 empirical reasearch papers on the effects of gamification on learning and education, "a considerable majority of the studies reportedmainly positively oriented results (71% of them) (...) [but] there is also a significant amount of research with null or mixed results (23% of them)".

These areas where gamification has been hugely implemented for the self-improvement of the users seem to have yielded either postive results, or neutral ones.

### Current industry review

Very little to no literature exists on the previous reasearch about new methods seeking to promote the consumption of news in people. This reinforces the idea of an unstoppable (in the sense that nothing has been done to stop such a trend) change in the source of news, expressed by Mike Vorhaus in the Forbes article *People Increasingly Turn To Social Media For News* (2020): "As newspapers have fallen dramatically in usage, and the national newscasts have dropped in ratings, the swing to new sources of information has accelerated considerably."

However, despite the lack of literature, when it comes to measures aiming at promoting the consumption of news in people, differerent websites exist already. (https://www.commonsense.org/education/top-picks/best-news-and-media-literacy-resources-for-students) gathers a considerable amount of applications which try to make their users more invested in the news, as well as more capable of thinking critically and "develop a mindfulness about how media is made, by whom it is made, and for what purposes it is made". Some of the applications listed are briefly described below:

- Abridge News: this application gathers the background information of each piece of news, and facilitates the takeaway points for the user. The latter can vote on how closely they agree on the opinions expressed in the article in question.
  
- Hypothes.is : this browser extension enables to add in-web annotations and discussion, which can be shared with other users.
  
- Knowhere: This website allows the user to check trending stories and to input different types of information and analysis regarding these stories, like the bias adopted, the facts included by the author, those not included, and then have Knowhere categorise them in different schemes. The user is also encouraged to reflect on the categorisation algorithm emplyed by Knowhere itself.
  
- NewsFeed Defender: . This website has the user try to maintain a website with displaying different kinds of news, while spotting fake posts that try to sneak in through hidden ads, viral deception and false reporting.
  
- BBC iReporter: this website has the user spot real stories and dodge fake news in a simulation of breaking news.
  

This, although incomplete, list of current projects aiming at promoting the consumption of news articles points towards the fact that the majority of applications with that aim employ the same three methods described in the *Usage of user representation through gamification for the development of new habits* section. Indeed, *Abridge News* and *Hypothes.is* make use of social interactions with the user's peers through sharing their opinions and takeaways on the articles read. On the other hand, *Knowhere* employs user feedback and reward to encourage the user critical thinking on the different aspects of a news article (author, date, facts included, etc.) as well as the way of organising those deductions made by the user of the website. Finally, *BBC iReporter* and *NewsFeedDefender* have the user follow a "progress path" with different difficulty levels.

### How the *CauseVisualiser* lands in the current industry

The literature review points towards the following problem: nowadays, people, especially younger generations, are consuming news that relate to events and information that are more societal and relating to lifestyle than news about events that can have a major consequence on politics and the world's order. The major consequence of this phenomenon is the downgrading of the population's average illiteracy on facts that have a direct correlation with the individual's democratic right (and duty) of voting in matters that are affected and themselves affect those events.

Following the loss of literacy on "old-fashioned" news (i.e articles about important, impactful event) in oppostion to emotion-arousing news (impacful events but also gossip, lifetsyle, etc.) *CauseVisualiser* seeks to establish a new way of promoting literacy on the former type of media through the representation of the news themselves from the reader's perspective in an engaging way which clearly displays two sides while maintaing the impression of the numerous intricacies surrounding the topic itself. Therefore, while tackling the problem described through sections 1,2 and 3 of the Literature review, *CauseVisualiser* also does so through an innovative method which falls out of the commonly known gamification strategies.

INSERT PIC HERE

The challenge that this project represents is that of, first, putting different news articles at the user's disposition following their topic of choice. Additionally, effort had to be made to represent different chess pieces dispositions in accordance to the average rating inputted by the user for each one of the articles relating to their topic of choice. These endeavours were identified as technical ones mainly.


#### Technical Timeline

##### Initial project skeleton

The construction of the SPA was first tackled from the Front-End, thtorugh the use of the Angular framework. As the project mainly revolved around the concept of links that could display the content of some articles, the *LinksComponent* was created first, alongside an example of a link, with a name and a path pointing towards the picture of the article's content to be displayed with the link. Accordingly, a *Link* interface that was implemented by the *LinksComponent* was also created.

![picture](SystemImplementationImages/Stage1.png)
<img src="https://github.com/fc16895/SoftwareEngineeringProject/blob/master/SystemImplementationImages/Stage1.png">

After modifying the corresponding *.html* files associated with *LinksComponent* and the appearance of the website, this was the result:

![picture](SystemImplementationImages/AngularFirstStage.png)

Many links were to be displayed, not just one, so a file containing many different ones, named *mock-links.ts* was created and imported in *App.component.ts*, and *App.component.html* was modified accordingly to display all of these. owever, each link had its own "details", i.e the picture of the corresponding article's content. Therefore, in order to have each one of the links in *mock-links.ts* to display its details upon clicking on them, a click-event binding was added in *App.component.html* under the form *(click)="onSelect(hero)*" and a *onSelect()* was added.

![picture](SystemImplementationImages/Stage2.png)

The resulting website was as show below:

![picture](SystemImplementationImages/AngularSecondStage.png)

Here, we can see that upon clicking on the second link from the list, its details were shown underneath.

Additionally, to make the handling of the details more maintainable, a separate *LinksDetailsComponent* was generated. A parent/child relationship was created through the use of an *@Input* decorator so the external *LinksComponent* could bind to it. The latter's correponding *.html* file was appendixed with a link detail binding under the form <app-link-detail [link]="selectedLink"></app-link-detail>.

![picture](SystemImplementationImages/Stage3.png)

Unsurprinsingly, the website's appearance did not change from the previous one, as only the organisation of the underlying files was modified for greater manageability.

However, it is very bad practice for components to save and provide data directly, as they are certainly not part of the database that was going to be implemented later. Data access had to be therefore delagated to a service, that was thus generated and named *LinkService*.

![picture](SystemImplementationImages/Stage4.png)

A method named *getLinks()* was added to *LinkService.ts* with the function to return all of the mock links that were created before this stage. A method of the same name was addded to *App.component.ts* in order to obtain the links from the service. The declaration of the links to be displayed had therefore to change from *links = LINKS* (mock links directly accessed from *mock-links.ts*) to *links: Link[] = []* (empty array of links to be filled in through the *getLinks()* method). However, as for a real remote server, the data is fetched in an inherently asynchronous manner from the API, the type of links returned by the *LinkService*'s *getLinks()* method was changed to Observable links. The method *getLinks()* in *LinksComponent.ts* was thus modified to subscribe the content obtained from the service and succesively populate the *links* array of links.

It was however very important that the website contained different sections to display the didferent type of information: the link search box, the list of resulting links, the ratings, the resulting chess board disposition. Many different routes therefore had to be created. For this, *app-routing* module was generated, and the needed files were modified accordingly (namely *app-routing.module.ts* and *app.component.html*). A*DashboardComponent* was created, which was going to present the "Search for a link" textbox, and a link to the dashboard was added to *app.component.html* under the form <a routerLink="/dashboard">Dashboard </a> (MAKE SURE THIS LINK APPEARS IN MD). The dashboard route was also added in *app-routing.module.ts* as the default route (everytime a user would load the page from scratch, the dashboard would be the first section to be displayed). Additionally, in order to stop the link details (the corresponding article's content) to be displayed under the list of links itself, and have the details be shown ina separate tab, the *link-detail* route was added to *app-routing.module.ts*, and a *routerLink* to the link details was added to *dashboard.component.html* and to *links.component.html*. Finally, to have the *link-detail* section to obtain the link-to-display through a URL, a *getLink()* method was added to *link-detail.component.ts* to extract the link name from the route and a *getLink()* method was added to *link.service.ts* to acquire the link with that name from the server that was going to be implemented later down the line.

![picture](SystemImplementationImages/Stage5.png)

The resutling website is shown below, where it can be seen below the SPA's title that there are two tabs, *Dashboard* and *Links* to access the soon-to-be implemented "search for a link" box and the list of resulting links respectively.

![picture](SystemImplementationImages/AngularFifthStage1.png)
![picture](SystemImplementationImages/AngularFifthStage2.png)

With the use of an Express.js server in sight, the right features had to be implemented on Angular first to fetch the data from an actual remote server. For this, the http services were enabled through *app.module.ts* and a simulated data server was generated under the name of *InMemoryData*. To accomodate for the usage of an http request to the API, the method *getLinks()* in *link.service.ts* was modified, by changing:

const links = of(LINKS);

return links;

with

return this.http.get<Link[]>(this.linksUrl)

Furthermore, to enable the user to search for an article by name, a *searchLinks()* method was added to *link.service.ts*, and a corresponding textbox implementing this method was inserted in *dashboard.component.html* under the form <app-link-search></app-link-search>. A *LinkSearchComponent* was generated, with a *search()* method in its *.ts* file and a search box in its *.html* file.

![picture](SystemImplementationImages/Stage6.png)

The resutling website's appearance was like shown below:

![picture](SystemImplementationImages/AngularSixthStage1.png)
![picture](SystemImplementationImages/AngularSixthStage2.png)
![picture](SystemImplementationImages/AngularSixthStage3.png)

Finally, the ratings given by the user to each one of the links searched for had to be implemented in the SPA. An equivalent approach to the one detailed before for the website's links was carried out. Obviously, some parts were left out, like component's details (do not apply to the concept of user-inputted ratings) and the search component. Nevertheless, an *addRating()* method was coded inside of the corresponding *RatingService* in order to input the rating into the API, and another *addRating()* was added to *rating.component.ts* in order to subscribe to the RatingService's method and push to the ratings list for display.

![picture](SystemImplementationImages/Stage7.png)

The resulting website's appearance was as shown below:

![picture](SystemImplementationImages/AngularRatingsStage1.png)
![picture](SystemImplementationImages/AngularRatingsStage2.png)
![picture](SystemImplementationImages/AngularRatingsStage3.png)


##### Server and database addition

At the stage shown at the end of the previous section, two different tasks were identified. First, the SPA had to be able to display different chess boards depending on the ratings inputted by the user on each one of the links searched for. However, the API and the database had to be coupled to this initial Angular "skeleton" described in the previous section. Thus, as the boards were going to depend on the value of the ratings and that implied a front-end/back-end communication, the implementation of the chess boards view was left for after the setup of the server and the database.

When an http request was made by one of the services, an action had to be triggered. Thus, the Express.js framework was used simulate the SPA's server in order to handle those http requests. Consequently, a server.js file was added to the project where the way the data is served upon users' requests is stated. The different types of http requests implemented by server.js, namely "get all the links", "update the ratings" and "add the links to the database" were specified in three different files, *all.js*, *update.js* and *new.js* respectively.

After setting up the server's specifications, the ratings component was merged into the link interface as a field named *rating* of type *number*, in order to make the front-end more manageable when interacting with the Back-end through express.

In order to store the data, a MongoDB container was set after specifying it in a *docker-compose.yml* file and running the command *docker-compose up -d*.

In oder to set up a connection between the server implemented through Express.js and the database container just mentioned, a *db.js* file, declaring the variables holding the user's specifications and the server's port, was created, and then "requested" within the *server.js* file.

(WHEN WAS APP.COMPONENT.TS MODIFIED WITH ALL THE LINKS ?)

Following the merging of the rating component into the link interface, the services present at the end of the building phase of the Angular skeleton had to be changed. An *outputService* was implemented, with a *getLinks()* method to obtain all the links whose name macthed the string inputted by the user in the dashboard's "search for an article" textbox (thanks to a *search()* method within *dashboard.component.ts*). Additionally, an *updateService* sets all the links to 0 whenever a new article is searched. Finally, *inputService* uses the links stored in *app.component.ts* as a seed to populate the database container when the website is first run.

##### Post-back-end angular modification

Once the API and the database were set up, the *BoardsComponent*, whose function was to display a different chess board disposition depending on the averae rating inputted by a user for a specific topic was added to the project. A *getLinks()* method within the *.ts* file would first populate the *links* array, declared as one of the class fields, with the database's links, that were searched for on the dashboard, through the *outputService*. Then, the average rating of for all the links outputted would be calculated and a different image of a chess game layout would be displayed depending on the value of this average.

#### System Implementation

- Stack architecture and system design (e.g. class diagrams, sequence diagrams).
- Back End - MongoDB - database implementation, the data model that you developed your back end from (e.g. entity relationship diagrams).
- Middle Tier - Express, Node, the RESTful API
- Front End - Angular. Details of implementation.
- Additional elements and components e.g. authentification. Tell us about any other aspects not covered above!
- Deployment details (including Docker), include how you have been achieving continuous integration and deployment.

##### Stack architecture and flow of data

The project is organised in 4 different parts, each one corresponding to one of the MEAN stacks functionalities.

![picture](SystemImplementationImages/Folders.png)

##### Front End

First, the files that were generated though Angular and whose purpose is to represent the front-end are comprise within the *src/app/* folder. There, the differenrent components (boards, links, link details, dashboard and app) sit. The links and link details components implement the *Link* interface (defined in the file *Links.ts*, within that smae path). The *Link* interface comprises the following properties:

- *name*, of type *string*, to hold the name of the link containing the article
  
- *imagePath*, of type *string*, to hold the path of the image containing the content of te article
  
- *rating*, of type *number*, to hold the value from 0 to 10 representing how positive the user thinks the article in question is for the cause they believe in
  

The *BoardsComponent* class has an array of links as field, which is initiliased through the *outputService*. An average of all the ratings of the links displayed on the website after searching for a topic of interest is calculated, and the value of this average determines the stage of the chess game to be displayed. The stages are represented here below, and belong the to the famous game that took place in 17th October in 1956 in New York, USA, between Bobby Fischer and Donald Byrne. It is commonly known as "The Game of the Century".

![picture](SystemImplementationImages/ThirdPhase.png)
![picture](SystemImplementationImages/FourthPhase.png)
![picture](SystemImplementationImages/FifthPhase.png)
![picture](SystemImplementationImages/FinalPhase.png)

The *DashboardComponent* class has a field named *toSearch*, of type *string*, which is then attributed to the argument of the only method in that class, *save(string: s)*.

Then, the *AppComponentClass* contains all the links that are first locally stored.

![picture](SystemImplementationImages/ListLinks.png)

Method *putLinks()* in *AppComponentClass* makes use of the services *inputService* and *updateService* to first input the links above in the database container, namely MongoDB. Then, *putLinks()* sets all the ratings of all the links to 0 in the database just mentioned.

Finally, the *LinksComponent* class declares an empty array of links, which is initialised when first running the application thanks to one of its methods, called *getLinks()*.

![picture](SystemImplementationImages/LinksComponentCode.png)

The *LinksDetailsComponent* class contains an Input property *Link* (annotated with the decorator *@Input*) so the external *LinksComponent* class can bind to it. This binding enables the details of each link (its rating and image representing the article content) to be enclosed in sub-component separated from the main *link* component, and thus to make the appliciation more manageable.

##### Middle Tier

- Express, Node, the RESTful API

As explained in the previous section, *inputService* and *updateService* initialise the database container by using *AppComponent* as seed, and set all the ratings to 0. On the other hand, *outputService* fetches the data from that database and forms the array of links *links* in *LinksComponent* for deployment in the front end. *linkService* provides a parent/child relationship between *LinksComponent* and *LinkDetailComponent* respectively. In order to achieve this, the RESTful API is defined in each one of these services through port 9999.

![picture](SystemImplementationImages/API.png)

Express.js handles the http requests generated by *inputService* and *updateService*, and those incoming towards *outputService* from port 9999, which acts as an intermidiate between these services juts metnioned and the file *server.js*. The latter declares the type of http requests that will be handled, sets up the port on which the server is to "listen" (in this case, port 9999) and declares the file *db.js* as required. *db.js* sets up the connection with the Mongo database container. The interactions between the server and the database, stemming from the http requests, are defined under *server/routes/* in the files *all.js* (to get all the links), *update.js* (to update the ratings) and *new.js* (to input the links in the database), and they are powered by Node.js which simulates the runtime environment of the server. These three files also defined the Mongo database that will be used. These interactions are then handled by Mongoose (a library for MongoDB and Node.js) and fetch/change the data in the database accordingly. Therefore, Express.js and Node.js work as the RESTful API of the website.

##### Back End

MongoDB - database implementation, the data model that you developed your back end from (e.g. entity relationship diagrams).

The database is set as a container specified in the *docker-compose.yml* file. When the application is started, the *inputService*, followed by the function defined in the *new.js* class populate the database using *AppComponent* as seed.

##### Standardised deployment

In order to have the application be runnable from different terminals, Docker was used in order to standardises the deployment. First, a *Dockerfile* was created to install an image of 10-alpine, which standardises the operating system. Then, it sets up the working directory, copies all the project files into the terminal being used and runs the command *node server.js*, which runs the whole application, including the express server and all the dependencies mentioned in the previous sections.

Nevertheless, in order to set up all the MEAN stacks (really) features in the terminal being used, a file called *docker-compose.yml* is created, where the Mongo Database is defined and the node.js is set up.

Running the command *docker-compose up -d* encompasses the containers defined above, as well as runs the command *Docker build .* in order to read the *Dockerfile* mentioned in *docker-compose.yml* and thus create and save an image of 10-alpine, while setting up all the needed files in the working terminal.

### Sprints & Project Management:

#### Group Working Methods

Our group use the agile model and the scrum method. Compared with waterfull model, the agile model has some advantages, like it is focused client process. So, it makes sure that the client is continuously involved during every stage. Moreover, agile team is likely to provide a better result from the development projects beause they are motivated and self-organized. However, it also has some limitations. It will take more time to implement an agile method compared to other development methodologies.

Scrum project management involves breaking down a complex project into smaller, more manageable parts known as sprints. You show the project to the client to implement their feedback (if any) at the end of every sprint cycle, and once you get the go-ahead, you move onto the next cycle.

Our group finished daily talk through WhatsApp, and had meeting on Teams if necessary.

#### Team Roles

Feilipe is a leader&coder, he set up the project framework and made suitble arrangements for every members. Liyanbing is a coder, he was responsible for the whole back end, including test and docker. Tao is also a coder, he connected the news link with the content of news. Linhong is a designer, she finished the display of the whole web.

#### Timeline

##### Week 6 - Week 7 (11/03/21-19/03/21)

- Focus on Project Proposal
- Discussion of the feasibility of ideas

Group members pay attention to the project proposal these two weeks. At first, Felipe came up with an idea about the storage of computer hard drive. But it seems a little hard for us to implement it. Linhong had an idea about disciplining baby's vision, however, the idea is not enough serious. At the end, Liyanbing put forward the idea about news filter, which is the prototype of our project.

##### Week 8 - Week 9 (22/03/21-31/03/21)

###### Weekly meeting 1 (29/03/21)

- Make the project more playful
- Discussion of the difficulty of the project

The CauseVisualiser is MVP. In the meeting, Felipe described his idea about how to make the news more fun, is to connect the current situation of news with a chessboard. According to the display of the chessboard, the user gets the clear circumstance of news like BLM. On March 31th, our group received the feedback from Allison. It is indeed feasible for us to finish it, but we should think about how to deal with the difficulity like API.

#### Use of Git

In the beginning, we created our own branch on github and pushed finished file to it. However, we were confronted with the conflict once. So, in the following process, we switched to the master. Before starting to do new assignment, we should clone the updatest file into our computer. And after finishing the code file, we pushed them to the origin master instead of branch.

During the sprints, we put our plan to the projects on github, it will show us what we should do this week, and it has three colums: to do, in prograss and done. Every member can know about the process of weekly sprint throughout this page.
