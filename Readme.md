### Introduction:

Our world has recently been living in a considerably fast-paced manner. 2020 alone has known a global pandemic, its consequent stock market crash, bushfires that have burnt a total of 47 million acres in Australia, the impeachment of former US president Donal Trump, as well as many other events that do not lack in details and intricacies around them. Paradoxically enough, the generations that have just entered, or are about to enter, the workforce have laid aside the traditional sources of information (TV news and non-digital newspapers). Indeed, as "Social media 'outstrips TV' as news source for young people" [1], these can be seen prefering to document themselves about the world's major issues through social media (Twitter and Instagram mainly), readily available on their smartphones and laptops. This migration comes alongside with a different view on the value of news. According to [2],:

- Traditional news brands see news as: what you should know.
- Young audiences see news as: what you should know (to an extent), but also what is useful to know, what is interesting to know, and what is fun to know.

This shows that there has been an increase in the variety of information that younger news-consumers obtain. Nevertheless, the devil is in the detail, and such a broad scope of headlines can come at a cost: the news that "they should know" might get easily disregarded when drowned in a world of information about "what is interesting to know and what is fun to know". Misleading information, more easily spread through social media than through TV and newspapers, can make young people believe in false ideals and have inaccurate opinions. The problem that is faced here is one of misinformation regarding topics that require a critical mind and an embrace of the many fine details and intricacies around them.

*CauseVisualiser* therefore seeks to bring the critical mindset vehicled by the reading of many different newspapers back to life, and to bridge the gap between "thing that should be known" and "things that are fun to know", in order to hopefully get younger generations to possess a sufficiently deep knowldedge about serious topics and causes they are interested in, so they can make use of a critical mind and reach a balanced, unbiased opinion on the matter. *CauseVisualiser* enables the user to search for a variety of articles about a topic of their choice, to read them and also to rate them in terms of how positive the information contained in the article just read is for the cause the user believes in/is interested in. Their own, personal and biased point of view is then represented by a chess board where the disposition of the pieces depends on how positive the overall situatio around the topic of choicen, measured through the inputted ratings, is in the user's eyes. This useful and playful way of viewing a current situation of interest seeks to make the activity of documenting oneself about serious topics more fun, and thus to shift an intrinsically biased and personal point of view towards a more critical and unbiased one.

### Literature review:

#### Migration of news sources

As younger generations have been progressively incorportating the active world, the way people consume news has progressively shifted from TV news and non-digital newspapers to digital news on their laptops and smartphones. The importance of the former has been declining as "In the UK, the average number of minutes of television viewing for the population as a whole declined from a high of 241 minutes per day in 2012 to 216 minutes per day in 2015, a 10% decline in three years” [3]. Additionally, "newspaper circulation has been declining for the whole decade[(the 2000's)][4]. The loss of consumers of both of these two sources of news has been reflected in a considerable increase in the number of people to obtain their news from social media. The Reuters Institute of Journalism at Oxford University issued a study in 2016 showing that a vast portion of the main social media platforms, when it came to people under 25 years old, used these mainly for the consumption of news: "Instagram news consumers were 11% of the social media population", "Twitter was statistically tied at 12%" and "Facebook leads with 36% of social media consumers using the social media giant for consuming news." [4]

#### Different motivations and hence different results

As stated in the report issued by the Reuters Institute, the motivation for the consumption of news for the younger audiences has drastically changed. Whereas older generations used to and still to this day consume news in order to get informed about serious, important topics, people belonging to the "Generation Z" mainly seek news with two main goals:

- progress: "I want to develop myself peronsally", ""I have goals I want to reach in my personal life and my work life", "I want to escape the limits of societal
  expectations or stereotypes" and "I want to look after myself too",
  
- enjoyment: "I want to have fun experiences", "I want to be entertained" and "I want to do what I love".
  

This shift in motivations for the consumption of news could be both the result of and the cause of the prevalence of social media as a source of information: social media provides a more enjoyable platform, therefore the content can be personalised to one's idea of self-improvement and enjoyment. On the other hand, younger generations, by living in a world of abundance of information and goods, seek thus self-improvement and enjoyment rather than just becoming literate about the worlds' issues, therefore social media content is deemed more attactive. In any case, the motivations for reading news amongst young people stem from a search of "what it can do for them as individuals - rather than for society as whole" like older people used to [4].

#### Consequences

These changes in the reasons for people to read the news have entailed, logically, a change in the content portrayed as news and thus have been "redefining
what constitutes news" [4]. As Derek Thomson states in *The Facebook effect in the news* [5], only part of each Facebook user's feed deals with actual "news" (politics, important societal events, etc). The stats mentioned earlier [4] about the amount of users on different social platforms that only wanted to consume news from there also indicate another underlying phenomenon: those news are surrounded, or rather "drowned", in a sea of content that ranges from humour to self-help, with gossip inbetween. In *The Facebook effect in the news* [6], the list of the most viral stories from Buzzfeed is displayed, and shows a wide variety of topics: terrorist attacks, music shows and why Ryan Gosling won't eat his cereal. In addition to this wide variety of topics, social media platforms make use of algorithms to personalise the offer of content to the user, thus "creat[ing] a “filter bubble”—a unique universe of information for each person—that potentially leads to consuming a narrow selection of news sources and perspectives" [7]. Additionally, the spread of misleading, false, or inaccurate news is way more easiliy vehicled by social media platforms than by TV broadcasting stations and newspapers [8].

This three-factor system has caused younger generations to be disengaged with what actual "news" are, by making them focus on content that produces "high-arousal emotions" [9].

#### Usage of user representation through gamification for the development of new habits

According to [10], the usage of gaming tools for purposes other than pure entertainment dates from 2002, when the *Serious Games* programs where created by Ben Sawyer and David Rejecsk to motivate and shape behaviours in american soldiers under simulated war environments. Since then, many other games were programmed with the purpose of teaching and shaping positive beahviours outside of the belligerant context, like *Games for Change* (created by Barry Joseph, Benjamin Stokes and Suzanne Seggerman to bring awareness and knowledge to the public about world-problems) and *Games for Health* (created by Ben Sawyer too witrh the objective of improving health and the delivery of healthcare).

However, according to [11], the main key-elements of gamification are:

- Progress paths: as part of a perception of play, objectives/tasks are usually
  concise in games.
  
- Feedback and reward: adding feedback and rapid rewards (e.g., points,
  badges, statuses), at the right time, are used as indicators of success and are
  an important feature for motivation.
  
- Social connection: accompanied by Internet, social networks and mobile
  applications of all sorts, gamified solutions boost group dynamics.
  

This trend in an increasing motivation for the development of self-improvement programs through gamification has been paired up with an increasing demand in the quality of aethestics and technology from the users.

The use of gamification for self-improvement has been widely present in health related contexts (weight control, eating habits, exercise, smoking, hand hygiene, etc.). According to [12], whose authors carried out a study on 19 papers that report empirical evidence on the effect of gamification on health and wellbeing, just over half (59%) of the studies reported positive effects, whereas 41% reported mixed or neutral effects. This indicates the presence of only a slight adavantage of using gamification for the promotion of health-related habits over the absence of gamification.

Other self-improvement sectors have known gamification, such as the promotion of civic and positive societal behaviours. For example, a study described in [13] was made around the effect of the installation of "smart" garbage containers in Zaragoza, Spain, that could record the "recycling" score of each perosn to use them, thus falling in the "progress paths" type of useful gamification mentioned above. The results show that "citizen participation increased by 32.2% and the amount of waste recycled increased by 17.2% in comparison to the data obtained before the implementation of [their] system."

Additionally, the education sector has been heavily coupled with gamification techniques in the past years. Majuri et al. points out in [11] that out of 128 empirical research papers on the effects of gamification on learning and education, "a considerable majority of the studies reported mainly positively oriented results (71% of them) (...) [but] there is also a significant amount of research with null or mixed results (23% of them)".

These areas where gamification has been hugely implemented for the self-improvement of the users seem to have yielded either postive results, or neutral ones.

### Current industry review

Very little to no literature exists on the previous research about the effectiveness of new methods seeking to promote the consumption of news in people. This reinforces the idea of an unstoppable (in the sense that nothing has been done to stop such a trend) change in the source of news, expressed by Mike Vorhaus in [14]: "As newspapers have fallen dramatically in usage, and the national newscasts have dropped in ratings, the swing to new sources of information has accelerated considerably."

However, despite the lack of literature on the results of such habit-promoting applications, differerent websites exist already. [15] gathers a considerable amount of applications which try to make their users more invested in the news, as well as more capable of thinking critically and "develop a mindfulness about how media is made, by whom it is made, and for what purposes it is made". Some of the applications listed are briefly described below:

- Abridge News: this application gathers the background information of each piece of news, and facilitates the takeaway points for the user. The latter can vote on how closely they agree on the opinions expressed in the article in question.
  
- Hypothes.is : this browser extension enables to add in-web annotations and discussion, which can be shared with other users.
  
- Knowhere: This website allows the user to check trending stories and to input different types of information and analysis regarding these stories, like the bias adopted, the facts included by the author, those not included, and then have Knowhere categorise them in different schemes. The user is also encouraged to reflect on the categorisation algorithm emplyed by Knowhere itself.
  
- NewsFeed Defender: . This website has the user try to maintain a website with displaying different kinds of news, while spotting fake posts that try to sneak in through hidden ads, viral deception and false reporting.
  
- BBC iReporter: this website has the user spot real stories and dodge fake news in a simulation of breaking news.
  

This, although incomplete, list of current projects aiming at promoting the consumption of news articles points towards the fact that the majority of applications with that aim employ the same three methods described in the *Usage of user representation through gamification for the development of new habits* section. Indeed, *Abridge News* and *Hypothes.is* make use of social interactions with the user's peers through sharing their opinions and takeaways on the articles read. On the other hand, *Knowhere* employs user feedback and reward to encourage the user critical thinking on the different aspects of a news article (author, date, facts included, etc.) as well as the way of organising those deductions made by the user of the website. Finally, *BBC iReporter* and *NewsFeedDefender* have the user follow a "progress path" with different difficulty levels.

### How *CauseVisualiser* lands in the current industry

The literature review points towards the following problem: nowadays, people, especially younger generations, are consuming news that relate to events and information that are more societal and relating to lifestyle than news about events that can have a major consequence on politics and the world's order. The major consequence of this phenomenon is the downgrading of the population's average literacy on facts that have a direct correlation with the individual's democratic right (and duty) of voting in matters that are affect and are themselves affected by those events.

Following the decrease in literacy on "old-fashioned" news (i.e articles about important, impactful event) in oppostion to emotion-arousing news (impacful events but also gossip, lifetsyle, etc.) *CauseVisualiser* seeks to establish a new way of promoting interest on the former type of media through the representation of news from the reader's perspective through different chess boards layouts, thus in an engaging way which clearly displays two sides while maintaining the impression of the numerous intricacies surrounding the topic itself. Therefore, while tackling the problem described through the first three sections of the Literature review, *CauseVisualiser* also does so through an innovative method which falls out of the commonly known gamification strategies.

The challenge that this project represented was that of, first, putting different news articles at the user's disposition following their topic of choice. Additionally, effort had to be made to represent different chess pieces dispositions in accordance to the average rating inputted by the user for each one of the articles relating to their topic of choice. These endeavours were identified as mainly technical ones.


#### Technical Timeline

##### Initial project skeleton

The construction of the Single Page Application (SPA) was first tackled from the Front-End, through the use of the Angular framework. As the project mainly revolved around the concept of links that could display the content of some articles, the *LinksComponent* was created first, alongside an example of a link, with a name and a path pointing towards the picture of the article's content to be displayed with the link. Accordingly, a *Link* interface that was implemented by the *LinksComponent* was also created.

<br/>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/fc16895/SoftwareEngineeringProject/blob/master/SystemImplementationImages/Stage1.png">
 </p>
<br/>

After modifying the corresponding *.html* files associated with *LinksComponent* and the appearance of the website, this was the result:

<br/>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/fc16895/SoftwareEngineeringProject/blob/master/SystemImplementationImages/AngularFirstStage.png">
 </p>
<br/>

Many links were to be displayed, not just one, so a file containing many different ones, named *mock-links.ts* was created and imported in *App.component.ts*, and *App.component.html* was modified accordingly to display all of these. However, each link had its own "details", i.e the picture of the corresponding article's content. Therefore, in order to have each one of the links in *mock-links.ts* display its details upon clicking on them, a click-event binding was added in *App.component.html* under the form *(click)="onSelect(hero)*" and an *onSelect()* method was added.

<br/>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/fc16895/SoftwareEngineeringProject/blob/master/SystemImplementationImages/Stage2.png">
 </p>
<br/>
 
The resulting website was as shown below:

<br/>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/fc16895/SoftwareEngineeringProject/blob/master/SystemImplementationImages/AngularSecondStage.png">
 </p>
<br/>

Here, we can see that upon clicking on the second link from the list, its details were shown underneath.

Additionally, to make the handling of the details more maintainable, a separate *LinksDetailsComponent* was generated. A parent/child relationship was created through the use of an *@Input* decorator so the external *LinksComponent* could bind to it. The latter's correponding *.html* file was appendixed with a link detail binding under the form <app-link-detail [link]="selectedLink"></app-link-detail>.

<br/>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/fc16895/SoftwareEngineeringProject/blob/master/SystemImplementationImages/Stage3.png">
 </p>
<br/>

Unsurprinsingly, the website's appearance did not change from the previous one, as only the organisation of the underlying files was modified for greater manageability.

However, it is very bad practice for components to save and provide data directly, as they are certainly not part of the database that was going to be implemented later. Data access had to be therefore delagated to a service, that was thus generated and named *LinkService*.

<br/>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/fc16895/SoftwareEngineeringProject/blob/master/SystemImplementationImages/Stage4.png">
 </p>
<br/>

A method named *getLinks()* was added to *LinkService.ts* with the function to return all of the mock links that were created before this stage. A method of the same name was addded to *App.component.ts* in order to obtain the links from the service. The declaration of the links to be displayed had therefore to change from *links = LINKS* (mock links directly accessed from *mock-links.ts*) to *links: Link[] = []* (empty array of links to be filled in through the *getLinks()* method). However, as for a real remote server, the data is fetched in an inherently asynchronous manner from the API, the type of links returned by the *LinkService*'s *getLinks()* method was changed to Observable links. The method *getLinks()* in *LinksComponent.ts* was thus modified to subscribe the content obtained from the service and succesively populate the *links* array of links.

It was however very important that the website contained different sections to display the different types of information: the link search box, the list of resulting links, the ratings, the resulting chess board disposition. Many different routes therefore had to be created. For this, *app-routing* module was generated, and the needed files were modified accordingly (namely *app-routing.module.ts* and *app.component.html*). A*DashboardComponent* was created, which was going to present the "Search for a link" textbox, and a link to the dashboard was added to *app.component.html* under the form <a routerLink="/dashboard">Dashboard </a>. The dashboard route was also added in *app-routing.module.ts* as the default route (everytime a user would load the page from scratch, the dashboard would be the first section to be displayed). Additionally, in order to stop the link details (the corresponding article's content) to be displayed under the list of links itself, and have the details be shown in a separate tab, the *link-detail* route was added to *app-routing.module.ts*, and a *routerLink* to the link details was added to *dashboard.component.html* and to *links.component.html*. Finally, to have the *link-detail* section to obtain the link-to-display through a URL, a *getLink()* method was added to *link-detail.component.ts* to extract the link name from the route and a *getLink()* method was added to *link.service.ts* to acquire the link with that name from the server that was going to be implemented later down the line.

<br/>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/fc16895/SoftwareEngineeringProject/blob/master/SystemImplementationImages/Stage5.png">
 </p>
<br/>

The resulting website is shown below, where it can be seen that under the SPA's title there are two tabs, *Dashboard* and *Links*, to access the soon-to-be implemented "search for a link" box and the list of resulting links respectively.

<img src="https://github.com/fc16895/SoftwareEngineeringProject/blob/master/SystemImplementationImages/AngularFifthStage2.png">
   </p>
<br/>

With the use of an Express.js server in sight, the right features had to be implemented on Angular first to fetch the data from an actual remote server. For this, the http services were enabled through *app.module.ts* and a simulated data server was generated under the name of *InMemoryData*. To accomodate for the usage of an http request to the API, the method *getLinks()* in *link.service.ts* was modified, by changing:


_const links = of(LINKS);
_return links;_
_with_
_return this.http.get<Link[]>(this.linksUrl)_


Furthermore, to enable the user to search for an article by name, a *searchLinks()* method was added to *link.service.ts*, and a corresponding textbox implementing this method was inserted in *dashboard.component.html* under the form <app-link-search></app-link-search>. A *LinkSearchComponent* was generated, with a *search()* method in its *.ts* file and a search box in its *.html* file.


<br/>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/fc16895/SoftwareEngineeringProject/blob/master/SystemImplementationImages/Stage6.png">
   </p>
<br/>

The resutling website's appearance was like shown below:

<br/>

<img src="https://github.com/fc16895/SoftwareEngineeringProject/blob/master/SystemImplementationImages/AngularSixthStage3.png">
   </p>
<br/>

Finally, the ratings given by the user to each one of the links searched for had to be implemented in the SPA. An equivalent approach to the one detailed before for the website's links was carried out. Obviously, some parts were left out, like component's details (do not apply to the concept of user-inputted ratings) and the search component. Nevertheless, an *addRating()* method was coded inside of the corresponding *RatingService* in order to input the rating into the API, and another *addRating()* was added to *rating.component.ts* in order to subscribe to the RatingService's method and push to the ratings list for display.

<img src="https://github.com/fc16895/SoftwareEngineeringProject/blob/master/SystemImplementationImages/Stage7.png">

##### Server and database addition

At the end of the stage shown at the end of the previous section, two different tasks were identified. First, the SPA had to be able to display different chess boards depending on the ratings inputted by the user on each one of the links searched for. However, the API and the database had to be coupled to this initial Angular "skeleton" described in the previous section. Thus, as the boards were going to depend on the value of the ratings and that implied a front-end/back-end communication, the implementation of the chess boards view was left for after the setup of the server and the database.

When an http request was made by one of the services, an action had to be triggered. Thus, the Express.js framework was used to simulate the SPA's server in order to handle those http requests. Consequently, a server.js file was added to the project where the way the data is served upon users' requests is stated. The different types of http requests implemented by server.js, namely "get all the links", "update the ratings" and "add the links to the database" were specified in three different files, *all.js*, *update.js* and *new.js* respectively.

After setting up the server's specifications, the ratings component was merged into the link interface as a field named *rating* of type *number*, in order to make the front-end more manageable when interacting with the Back-end through Express.js.

In order to store the data, a MongoDB container was set after specifying it in a *docker-compose.yml* file and running the command *docker-compose up -d*.

In oder to set up a connection between the server implemented through Express.js and the database container just mentioned, a *db.js* file, declaring the variables holding the user's specifications and the server's port, was created, and then "requested" within the *server.js* file.

Following the merging of the rating component into the link interface, the services present at the end of the building phase of the Angular skeleton had to be changed. An *outputService* was implemented, with a *getLinks()* method to obtain all the links whose name matched the string inputted by the user in the dashboard's "search for an article" textbox (thanks to a *search()* method within *dashboard.component.ts*). Additionally, an *updateService* sets all the links to 0 whenever a new article is searched. Finally, *inputService* uses the links stored in *app.component.ts* as a seed to populate the database container when the website is first run.

##### Post-back-end angular modification

Once the API and the database were set up, the *BoardsComponent*, whose function was to display a different chess board disposition depending on the averae rating inputted by a user for a specific topic was added to the project. A *getLinks()* method within the *.ts* file would first populate the *links* array, declared as one of the class fields, with the database's links, that were searched for on the dashboard, through the *outputService*. Then, the average rating of for all the links outputted would be calculated and a different image of a chess game layout would be displayed depending on the value of this average.

#### System Implementation

##### Stack architecture and flow of data

The project is organised in 4 different parts, each one corresponding to one of the MEAN stacks frameworks.

<br/>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/fc16895/SoftwareEngineeringProject/blob/master/SystemImplementationImages/Folders.png">
   </p>
<br/>

##### Front End

First, the files that were generated though Angular and whose purpose is to represent the front-end are comprised within the *src/app/* folder. There, the different components (boards, links, link details, dashboard and app) sit. The links and link details components implement the *Link* interface (defined in the file *Links.ts*, within that same path). The *Link* interface comprises the following properties:

- *name*, of type *string*, to hold the name of the link containing the article
  
- *imagePath*, of type *string*, to hold the path of the image containing the content of the article
  
- *rating*, of type *number*, to hold the value from 0 to 10 representing how positive the user thinks the article in question is for the cause they believe in.
  

The *BoardsComponent* class has an array of links as field, which is initiliased through the *outputService*. An average of all the ratings of the links displayed on the website after searching for a topic of interest is calculated, and the value of this average determines the stage of the chess game to be displayed. The stages are represented here below, and belong the to the famous game that took place on 17th October in 1956 in New York, USA, between Bobby Fischer and Donald Byrne. It is commonly known as "The Game of the Century".

  </p>
<br/>

The *DashboardComponent* class has a field named *toSearch*, of type *string*, which is then injected as argument of the only method in that class, *save(string: s)*.

Then, the *AppComponentClass* contains all the links that are first locally stored.

<br/>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/fc16895/SoftwareEngineeringProject/blob/master/SystemImplementationImages/ListLinks.png">
   </p>
<br/>

Method *putLinks()* in *AppComponentClass* makes use of the services *inputService* and *updateService* to first input the links above in the database container, namely MongoDB. Then, *putLinks()* sets all the ratings of all the links to 0 in the database just mentioned. This process is only run once when the the command _docker-compose up -d_ is run as _app.component.ts_ is used as "seed" for the MongoDB container.

Finally, the *LinksComponent* class declares an empty array of links, which is initialised when first running the application thanks to one of its methods, called *getLinks()*.

<br/>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/fc16895/SoftwareEngineeringProject/blob/master/SystemImplementationImages/LinksComponentCode.png">
   </p>
<br/>

The *LinksDetailsComponent* class contains an Input property *Link* (annotated with the decorator *@Input*) so the external *LinksComponent* class can bind to it. This binding enables the details of each link (its rating and image representing the article content) to be enclosed in sub-component separated from the main *link* component, and thus to make the appliciation more manageable.

As explained in the previous section, *inputService* and *updateService* initialise the database container by using *AppComponent* as seed, and set all the ratings to 0. On the other hand, *outputService* fetches the data from that database and forms the array of links *links* in *LinksComponent* for deployment in the front end. *linkService* provides a parent/child relationship between *LinksComponent* and *LinkDetailComponent* respectively. In order to achieve this, the RESTful API is defined in each one of these services through port 9999.

   </p>
<br/>

Express.js handles the http requests generated by *inputService* and *updateService*, and those incoming towards *outputService* from port 9999, which acts as an intermediate stage between these services just mentioned and the file *server.js*. The latter declares the type of http requests that will be handled, sets up the port on which the server is to "listen" (in this case, port 9999) and declares the file *db.js* as required. *db.js* sets up the connection with the Mongo database container. The interactions between the server and the database, stemming from the http requests, are defined under *server/routes/* in the files *all.js* (to get all the links), *update.js* (to update the ratings) and *new.js* (to input the links in the database), and they are powered by Node.js which simulates the runtime environment of the server. These three files also define the Mongo database that will be used. These interactions are then handled by Mongoose (a library for MongoDB and Node.js) and fetch/change the data in the database accordingly. Therefore, Express.js and Node.js work as the RESTful API of the website.

##### Back End


The database is set as a container specified in the *docker-compose.yml* file. When the application is started, the *inputService*, followed by the function defined in the *new.js* class populate the database using _app.component.ts_ as seed.

##### Standardised deployment

In order to have the application be runnable from different terminals, Docker was used in order to standardise the deployment. First, a *Dockerfile* was created to install an image of 10-alpine, which standardises the operating system. Then, it sets up the working directory, copies all the project files into the terminal being used and runs the command *node server.js*, which runs the whole application, including the express server and all the dependencies mentioned in the previous sections.

Nevertheless, in order to set up all the MEAN stacks features in the terminal being used, a file called *docker-compose.yml* is created, where the Mongo Database is defined and the node.js is set up.

Running the command *docker-compose up -d* encompasses the containers defined above, as well as runs the command *Docker build .* in order to read the *Dockerfile* mentioned in *docker-compose.yml* and thus create and save an image of 10-alpine, while setting up all the needed files in the working terminal.

### Sprints & Project Management:

#### Group Working Methods

Our group used the agile model and the scrum method. Compared with the waterfull model, the agile model had some advantages, as it is more focused on the client process. Indeed, it makes sure that the client is continuously involved at every stage. Moreover, agile team was more likely to provide a better result for the development of the project because it implies a greater motivation and self-organisation. However, it also has some limitations: it takes more time to implement an agile method compared to other development methodologies.

Scrum project management involves breaking down a complex project into smaller, more manageable parts known as sprints. The project is shown to the client so they can provide feedback (if any) at the end of every sprint cycle, and once the go-ahead is given, the next cycle can tackled.

Our group finished daily talk through WhatsApp, and had meeting on Teams if necessary.

#### Team Roles

Felipe was the leader and coder of the project's scafoolding. He set up the project environment and assigned suitable tasks to every member. Liyanbing was responsible for the whole back end, including the testing and docker. Tao made sure the news links displayed the content of the corresponding articles, and refined some of the Front-End details. Linhong made sure there was a smooth transtion between the different project stages and ensured an harmonious display of the SPA's content.

#### Timeline

##### Week 6 - Week 7 (11/03/21-19/03/21)

- Focus on Project Proposal
- Discussion of the feasibility of ideas

The group members paid attention to the project proposal during those two weeks. At first, Felipe came up with an idea about the storage of computer hard drive. But it seemed a little hard to implement. Linhong had an idea about disciplining baby's vision, however, the idea did not tackle a serious enough problem. At the end, Liyanbing put forward the idea of a news filter, intending to get rid of inaccurate news. This led to the ideation of a website aiming at promoting the consumption of actual news and thus the development of a critical mindset.

##### Week 8 - Week 9 (22/03/21-31/03/21)

###### Weekly meeting 1 (29/03/21)

- Make the project more playful
- Discussion of the difficulty of the project

In the meeting, Felipe described his idea about how to make the news more fun, which was by connecting the current situation of news with a chessboard. According to the display of the chessboard, the user would get a clear idea of how positive the circumstances surrounding a topic of their choice is. On March 31th, the group received feedback from Allison, who stated that it was a feasible and interesting project to embark on, while emphasising on the possible difficulty of the API implementation.

#### Use of Git

In the beginning, we created our own branch on github and pushed every finished file to it. However, as the project started eveolving, many conflicts started coming up. Consequently, different branches were created: one for each member of the gorup, a _master_ one and a _dev_ one. This ensured that individual modifcations could be seen and discussed before merging them to the _dev_ branch, and before merging the latter to the _master_ branch. Every member would clone the most up-to-date version of the project on their local repository and would work on it before pushing their respective changes to their respective branches.

During the sprints, a plan of the project was put up on GitHub, in order to display the different modifications and additions and their evolution. this plan contained three colums: "to do", "in progress" and "done". Every member could then know about the details going on during the weekly sprint.

### Conclusion

#### Working practices
As a group of four, we need to work more efficiently. Therefore, we divided our work at an
early stage. Linhong and Tao will bring the whole front end, and Felipe and Liyanbing will set
up the backend. Because we had been clear about the area to be working on, we were able
to focus on more relevant knowledge for our tasks.
We started moving on easter holiday, and that’s from when we have being messaging each
other a lot on WhatsApp. Compared to meeting, communicating through a text message has
certain benefits: there will always be a record; people are less pressured; and there will be
little need for finding a time that everyone is available. Things progress swiftly since we
started. As we got to know more about the technology we were going to use, we were able
to created more detailed missions. Felipe as the leader set up the targets, then we would all
try to finish them in time.

#### Working remotely

During this time, lots of communication is needed, as some of the functions need
collaborations. Collaborating remotely brought us some challenges. For example, although
everyone knows how our website is working, in terms of design details, we still have sightly
different ideas, even without recognizing it until others are going to use this part. But the
good side is, we have more flexibility on working time and can kick off any time we want.

#### Fulfilling the project

Our project is going to present the users the news they searched for, and display a
visualization of their ratings. Before we had a closer look at how web applications work and
learned about how to develop using MEAN stacks, we had already discussed about its
availability with our lecturers. Absorbing the advices that we can focus on presenting our
web page and avoid using crawler script, the whole task seems clear.
Currently, we put a number of news beforehand into the mongodb, and allow users to search
from them. Users then can add their ratings for each news presented to them. Finally, a
display of the ratings through a chess board will conclude the user’s opinion about the news.
We have fulfilled the whole function of the design, with lots of improvements to be made
Future development
One of the important upgrade is fetching news automatically. This can possibly be done by
using google APIs and scripting. So latest news headings google shows will be added to the
database as well as the content fetched by scripts. Or it just needs to register a collection of
news websites and fetch news from them from time to time.
Another thing we need to improve is the UI design of the website. For example, we had a
proposal of reducing the number of subpages from four to three for the convenience of the
users. It was not taken as we did not have time for this plan. Besides, there are still lots to do
to make it a real world web application: supports for different platforms, user system,
advanced information display on the chess board …etc.

#### Social and Ethical implications

Hopefully, this application will improve the knowledge and motivation of younger generation
about top news. In a time of fragmented reading, people sometimes fail to pay attention to
the source of information, and easily influenced by recommendation algorithm. Our
application can be a force to help people reform their habit of reading, and reflect on different
views by doing the game of rating.
However, there will be some potential ethical issues. A critical is copyrights. As we are
actually displaying the content of new websites, it is unclear if we are allowed to do so ,or if
can gain profits from this web application. And because users will input their interested
topics and provide their opinions about the news, privacy is another concern. Moreover, if we
are going to have a user account system for storing search history, it is our responsibility to
keep the data safe.
