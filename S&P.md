
## Sprints & Project Management:

### Group Working Methods

Our group use the agile model and the scrum method. Compared with waterfull model, the agile model has some advantages, like it is focused client process. So, it makes sure that the client is continuously involved during every stage. Moreover, agile team is likely to provide a better result from the development projects beause  they are motivated and self-organized. However, it also has some limitations. It will take more time to implement an agile method compared to other development methodologies.

Scrum project management involves breaking down a complex project into smaller, more manageable parts known as sprints. You show the project to the client to implement their feedback (if any) at the end of every sprint cycle, and once you get the go-ahead, you move onto the next cycle.

Our group finished daily talk through WhatsApp, and had meeting on Teams if necessary.  



### Team Roles

Feilipe is a leader&coder, he set up the project framework and made suitble arrangements for every members. Liyanbing is a coder, he was responsible for the whole back end, including test and docker. Tao is also a coder, he connected the news link with the content of news. Linhong is a designer, she finished the display of the whole web.

### Timeline

#### Week 6 - Week 7 (11/03/21-19/03/21)

* Focus on Project Proposal
* Discussion of the feasibility of ideas

Group members pay attention to the project proposal these two weeks. At first, Felipe came up with an idea about the storage of computer hard drive. But it seems a little hard for us to implement it. Linhong had an idea about disciplining baby's vision, however, the idea is not enough serious. At the end, Liyanbing put forward the idea about news filter, which is the prototype of our project. 

#### Week 8 - Week 9 (22/03/21-31/03/21)

##### Weekly meeting 1 (29/03/21)

* Make the project more playful
* Discussion of the difficulty of the project

The CauseVisualiser is MVP. In the meeting, Felipe described his idea about how to make the news more fun, is to connect the current situation of news with a chessboard.  According to the display of the chessboard, the user gets the clear circumstance of news like BLM. On March 31th, our group received the feedback from Allison. It is indeed feasible for us to finish it, but we should think about how to deal with the difficulity like API.

### Use of Git

In the beginning, we created our own branch on github and pushed finished file to it. However, we were confronted with the conflict once. So, in the following process, we switched to the master. Before starting to do new assignment, we should clone the updatest file into our computer. And after finishing the code file, we pushed them to the origin master instead of branch.

During the sprints, we put our plan to the projects on github, it will show us what we should do this week, and it has three colums: to do, in prograss and done. Every member can know about the process of weekly sprint throughout this page.
