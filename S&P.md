
## Sprints & Project Management:

### Group Working Methods

Our group use the agile model and the scrum method. Compared with waterfull model, the agile model has some advantages, like it is focused client process. So, it makes sure that the client is continuously involved during every stage. Moreover, agile team is likely to provide a better result from the development projects beause  they are motivated and self-organized. However, it also has some limitations. It will take more time to implement an agile method compared to other development methodologies.

Scrum project management involves breaking down a complex project into smaller, more manageable parts known as sprints. You show the project to the client to implement their feedback (if any) at the end of every sprint cycle, and once you get the go-ahead, you move onto the next cycle.

### Use of Git

In the beginning, we created our own branch on github and pushed finished file to it. However, we were confronted with the conflict once. So, in the following process, we switch to the master. Before starting to do new arrangement, we should clone the updatest file into our computer. And after finishing the code file, we push them to the origin master instead of branch.

During the sprints, we put our plan to the projects on github, it will show us what we should do this week, and it has three colums: to do, in prograss and done. Every member can know about the process of weekly sprint throughout this page.
